Small fundamental coding exercises. 

Some of these are in direct response to or are inspired by problems found in Cracking the Coding Interview 4th ed.

More interesting fundamental concepts are explored in folders:

linked_list (JAVA): generics/templates
search_trees (C++): inline constructors, namespaces
shapes (JAVA): inhertiance, interfaces
